                What we accomplished:
              </h3>
              We developed three papers that built on each other to understand the spread of anti-science and then more generally extremist behavior:
                  - First we focused our study on vaccine hesitancy, a component in modern-day anti-science discussions. We then developed an open source tool, <a href="https://github.com/Matheus-Schmitz/avaxtar">AVAXTAR</a> to predict who will be anti-vaccine on social media. Our analysis uncovered a range of differences between anti-vaccine and regular users, such as more negative sentiment in anti-vaccine users:<br>
              <h4> Normal user's tweet: </h4> As first runner-up to my esteemed @StarTrek colleague @levarburton [when we appeared on #TheWeakestLink ], I would be honored to try my hand as #Jeopardy guest host. My experience as a science presenter for @exploreplanets emboldens me to #boldlygo !<br>
              <h4> Anti-vaccine user's tweet: </h4> Even with the inflated (for scaremongering purposes I can only assume) figure of 126k people who died WITH (not OF remember) covid19, that would mean that in a whole year this ”killer virus” hasnt even managed to kill 0.19% of almost 68 million people in the UK. ”pandemic”<br>
              Moreover, anti-vaccine users could be predicted with high accuracy a year in advance, in part because of their frequent use of conspiratorial language.

				    Vaccine hesitancy, which has recently been driven by online narratives, significantly degrades the efficacy of vaccination strategies, such as those for COVID-19. 
                              Despite broad agreement in the medical community about the safety and efficacy of available vaccines, a large number of social media users continue to be inundated with false information about vaccines and are indecisive or unwilling to be vaccinated. The goal of this study is to better understand anti-vaccine sentiment by developing a system capable of automatically identifying the users responsible for spreading anti-vaccine narratives. We introduce a publicly available Python package capable of analyzing Twitter profiles to assess how likely that profile is to share anti-vaccine sentiment in the future. The software package is built using text embedding methods, neural networks, and automated dataset generation and is trained on several million tweets. We find this model can accurately detect anti-vaccine users up to a year before they tweet anti-vaccine hashtags or keywords. We also show examples of how text analysis helps us understand anti-vaccine discussions by detecting moral and emotional differences between anti-vaccine spreaders on Twitter and regular users. Our results will help researchers and policy-makers understand how users become anti-vaccine and what they discuss on Twitter. Policy-makers can utilize this information for better targeted campaigns that debunk harmful anti-vaccination myths.                             </div><br>

Political Partisanship and Antiscience Attitudes in Online Discussions About COVID-19: Twitter Content Analysis</a></h2><br>
				    <h3>Ashwin Rao, Fred Morstatter, Minda Hu, Emily Chen, Keith Burghardt, Emilio Ferrara,  Kristina Lerman</h3>
The novel coronavirus pandemic continues to ravage communities across the United States. Opinion surveys identified the importance of political ideology in shaping perceptions of the pandemic and compliance with preventive measures. The aim of this study was to measure political partisanship and antiscience attitudes in the discussions about the pandemic on social media, as well as their geographic and temporal distributions. We analyzed a large set of tweets from Twitter related to the pandemic, collected between January and May 2020, and developed methods to classify the ideological alignment of users along the moderacy (hardline vs moderate), political (liberal vs conservative), and science (antiscience vs proscience) dimensions. We found a significant correlation in polarized views along the science and political dimensions. Moreover, politically moderate users were more aligned with proscience views, while hardline users were more aligned with antiscience views. Contrary to expectations, we did not find that polarization grew over time; instead, we saw increasing activity by moderate proscience users. We also show that antiscience conservatives in the United States tended to tweet from the southern and northwestern states, while antiscience moderates tended to tweet from the western states. The proportion of antiscience conservatives was found to correlate with COVID-19 cases. Our findings shed light on the multidimensional nature of polarization and the feasibility of tracking polarized opinions about the pandemic across time and space through social media data.
