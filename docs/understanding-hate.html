				    <h3>Matheus Schmitz, Keith Burghardt, Goran Muric</h3>
				    Social media offers ways for stifled voices to be heard, yet it also allows hate speech from fringe communities to spread to mainstream channels.
				    This paper measures the impact of joining fringe hateful communities by leveraging causal modeling methods on Reddit data. 
				    We measure members' usage of hate speech within and outside the four hateful communities before and after they become active participants, and find
				    an increase in hate speech both within and outside the originating community that persists for months, 
				    implying that joining such community leads to a spread of hate speech throughout the platform. 
				    Our results provide new evidence of the harmful effects of echo chambers and the potential benefit of moderating them to reduce adoption of hateful speech.

The increase in hate speech persists for several months. After 6 months, the hate speech has yet to fall back to pre-joining levels.

				    <h3>Daniel Hickey, Matheus Schmitz, Daniel Fessler, Paul Smaldino, Goran Muric, Keith Burghardt</h3>
				    While online hate groups pose significant risks to the health of online platforms and safety of marginalized groups, 
				    little is known about what causes users to become active in hate groups and the effect of social interactions on 
				    furthering their engagement. We address this gap by first developing tools to find hate communities within Reddit, 
				    and then leverage causal modeling on the 25 known and discovered hateful subreddits. 
				    We evaluate the effect of replies on engagement in hateful subreddits by comparing users who receive replies to their first post 
				    (the treatment) to equivalent control users who did not. We find users with replies are less 
				    likely to become engaged in hateful subreddits than users who do not, 
				    while the opposite effect is observed for a matched sample of similar-sized non-hateful subreddits. 
				    Using the Google Perspective API and VADER, we discover that hateful community first-repliers are much more toxic, 
				    negative, and attack the posters more often than non-hateful first-repliers. 
				    In addition, we uncover a negative correlation between engagement and attacks or toxicity of first-repliers. 
				    We simulate the cumulative engagement of hateful and non-hateful subreddits under the 
				    contra-positive scenario of friendly first-replies and find that attacks dramatically reduce engagement in hateful subreddits. 
				    These results counter-intuitively imply that, although under-moderated communities allow hate to fester, 
				    the resulting contexts are such that direct social interaction does not encourage further participation, 
				    thus endogenously constraining the harmful role that these communities could play as recruitment venues for antisocial beliefs.

			Replies in hateful subreddits lead to significantly less engagement than replies in non-hateful subreddits. Y-axis is the ratio in the probability of a user continuing to post with a reply divided by the probability without a reply. Values above one indicate replies correlate with greater engagement, while values less than one indicate less engagement after a reply.

			The likelihood replies increase activity are negatively correlated with attacks and toxicity, and positively correlated with sentiment. 
			Attacks and toxicity are higher in hateful subreddits replies, while sentiment is lower.  
			Top row: relationships between engagement risk ratios and mean attack on commenter probability (A), toxicity (B), and sentiment (C) of subreddits.
			Bottom row: distributions across all users for (A) attack on commenter probability, (B) toxicity probability, and  (C) valence for replies in hateful and non-hateful subreddits. 
			substitution of synonymous non-hate terms does not alter ability of the models to distinguish between subreddit type.

			Simulated growth of subreddits. (A) Empirical and simulated growth curve of engaged users in r/MGTOW. (B) Predicted increases in engaged users for hateful and non-hateful subreddits given attack on commenter probability, toxicity, and sentiment of negative replies are set to zero. The White dots represent medians, while the thick gray bars represent the inter-quartile range and the thin gray lines represent 95\% quantiles. These results indicate that hateful subreddits grow more slowly than they potentially could due to the nature of their replies, hence hateful subreddits are counter-productive to their own growth because their hate is undirected.
