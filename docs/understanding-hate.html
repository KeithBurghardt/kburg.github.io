				    <h3>Matheus Schmitz, Keith Burghardt, Goran Muric</h3>
				    Social media offers ways for stifled voices to be heard, yet it also allows hate speech from fringe communities to spread to mainstream channels.
				    This paper measures the impact of joining fringe hateful communities by leveraging causal modeling methods on Reddit data. 
				    We measure members' usage of hate speech within and outside the four hateful communities before and after they become active participants, and find
				    an increase in hate speech both within and outside the originating community that persists for months, 
				    implying that joining such community leads to a spread of hate speech throughout the platform. 
				    Our results provide new evidence of the harmful effects of echo chambers and the potential benefit of moderating them to reduce adoption of hateful speech.

				    <h3>Daniel Hickey, Matheus Schmitz, Daniel Fessler, Paul Smaldino, Goran Muric, Keith Burghardt</h3>
				    While online hate groups pose significant risks to the health of online platforms and safety of marginalized groups, 
				    little is known about what causes users to become active in hate groups and the effect of social interactions on 
				    furthering their engagement. We address this gap by first developing tools to find hate communities within Reddit, 
				    and then leverage causal modeling on the 25 known and discovered hateful subreddits. 
				    We evaluate the effect of replies on engagement in hateful subreddits by comparing users who receive replies to their first post 
				    (the treatment) to equivalent control users who did not. We find users with replies are less 
				    likely to become engaged in hateful subreddits than users who do not, 
				    while the opposite effect is observed for a matched sample of similar-sized non-hateful subreddits. 
				    Using the Google Perspective API and VADER, we discover that hateful community first-repliers are much more toxic, 
				    negative, and attack the posters more often than non-hateful first-repliers. 
				    In addition, we uncover a negative correlation between engagement and attacks or toxicity of first-repliers. 
				    We simulate the cumulative engagement of hateful and non-hateful subreddits under the 
				    contra-positive scenario of friendly first-replies and find that attacks dramatically reduce engagement in hateful subreddits. 
				    These results counter-intuitively imply that, although under-moderated communities allow hate to fester, 
				    the resulting contexts are such that direct social interaction does not encourage further participation, 
				    thus endogenously constraining the harmful role that these communities could play as recruitment venues for antisocial beliefs.
